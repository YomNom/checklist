# Checklist
This web application isn't anything deeper than writing down things you need to do in general. It's just done in a "cutting pictures out of a magazine" way. 

# From Version 1
This picture is of the first version of this website. I went through a major asthetic change because this was a last-minute scramble to get something, anything functional working. I revisited this project after knowing more and wanted to create somthing that worked while looking at the original sketches/design for this project.

I had basically trashed the sketches and threwaway a nice visual rendition of the site which is lost forever now. Instead of a notepad to put all the tasks to do on, I put each task in a little box and pushed in the form to make more tasks. Because of I was working from a sveltekit template, my data was nested and couldn't react to new tasks being added. In this new version, I went back to the notepad and evolved that as a content page or outline of all the tasks. I still ditched the tab categories because in the end, this is just things you need to do. If you need that many categories, it's suddenly turning everything into a planner. It's been awhile since the planning, but I also really didn't have much on the forms and how the tasks would be modifiable. The asthetic also changed a lot. Initially, I had been going for a kitchin theme which had become a theme of whimsy in the first version. Then in this version, I went for an office theme with a blue color scheme.

I wish there were other things I could say that I changed from version 1 but unfortunately, version 1 didn't have much.

# What does this version do?

All that being said, this version also is missing some functionality as you can see in the video and that was due to time contraints. Features I missed was being able to modify information of current tasks and displaying more statistics of all the tasks the user did. Although, besides time, it was because I was a lot more ambitious. Going with the office theme, I had made the display of a task a post it note and was struck with inspiration to have it be move aroundabile on a corkboard. 

# If there were no deadlines

Revisiting this project in the future, <br>

I would add in some settings that would allow the user to change the color of the post it notes and the overall colorscheme of the entire website. Other settings would be clearing the task history. <br>

With more experience, I would modify the overall background layout with it being centered on a column in the middle of the page with a kitchen tile background, like you can see in the sketch beloy.
